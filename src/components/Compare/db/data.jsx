      "The T3 family in AWS is a burstable performance instance family that offers a balance of compute power, memory, and network performance at a low cost. These instances are designed for workloads with variable or unpredictable CPU usage patterns. Here are some key details about the T3 instance family:\n\nBurstable Performance: T3 instances provide baseline CPU performance with the ability to burst CPU usage when needed. They accumulate CPU credits during periods of low usage, which can be used to burst above the baseline when the workload demands it.\n\nInstance Types: The T3 family includes various instance types, such as T3.nano, T3.micro, T3.small, T3.medium, T3.large, and more. These instance types differ in terms of CPU, memory, and network capacity.\n\nProcessor and Architecture: The T3 instances use custom-designed AWS Nitro System processors based on the Intel Skylake architecture. These processors are optimized for cloud workloads and provide a balance of performance and efficiency.\n\nNetwork Performance: T3 instances offer moderate network performance, suitable for general-purpose workloads. They support the Amazon Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) technology for enhanced networking capabilities.\n\nUse Cases: T3 instances are suitable for a wide range of workloads, including microservices, small databases, development and test environments, low-traffic websites, and other applications with variable or unpredictable CPU usage.\n\nIt's important to note that T3 instances are designed for burstable workloads and have CPU performance limits based on the instance size.

    description:
      "The T4g family in AWS is a burstable performance instance family that is powered by AWS Graviton2 processors, which are based on the Arm architecture. The T4g instances offer a cost-effective option for workloads with variable or bursty compute requirements. Here are some key details about the T4g instance family:\n\nBurstable Performance: T4g instances are designed to provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst CPU usage for short periods when needed. This burstable performance is beneficial for applications with intermittent or variable workloads.\n\nAWS Graviton2 Processor: T4g instances are powered by AWS Graviton2 processors, which are custom-designed by AWS based on the Arm architecture. These processors deliver excellent performance, energy efficiency, and cost savings.\n\nInstance Types: The T4g family offers various instance types, including T4g.nano, T4g.micro, T4g.small, T4g.medium, T4g.large, T4g.xlarge, T4g.2xlarge, and more. These instance types provide different combinations of CPU cores, memory, and network capacity.\n\nCost-Effective: T4g instances offer a cost-effective option for workloads that do not consistently require high CPU performance. They provide the benefits of the AWS Graviton2 processors at a lower price point.\n\nSupported by AWS Nitro System: T4g instances leverage the AWS Nitro System, which provides a lightweight hypervisor and offloads various virtualization functions to dedicated hardware, resulting in improved performance and security.\n\nThe T4g instances are suitable for a wide range of workloads, including microservices, small-scale web servers, development environments, and low-traffic applications. They offer a balance of cost-efficiency and performance for workloads that can benefit from burstable CPU performance.",
